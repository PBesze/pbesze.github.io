Here you can see some *example codes* of me used in tasks and exercises during my studies.

**Queries in Arraylist**<br>
To solve [a task on hackerrank.com](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/java-arraylist){:target="_blank"} I wrote the following code:<br>
 [Example code >>>>](https://pbesze.github.io/sample-codes/queries-in-arraylist)
	 <br>
**Following pseudocode** <br>
In a complicated algorithm it is usefull to write and follow pseudocode as it was done for example in this trie search:<br>
 [Example code >>>>](https://pbesze.github.io/sample-codes/following-pseudocode)
 <br>
**Implementing (the Comparator) interface**
Implementing abstract classes and interfaces are effective tools for the functionality of multiple inheritance.<br>
[Example code >>>>](https://pbesze.github.io/sample-codes/implements-comparator)
  <br>

**Implementing compareTo() method** <br>
The compareTo method is another way of comparing objects:<br>
 [Example code >>>>](https://pbesze.github.io/sample-codes/implementing-compareTo)
  <br>
 
  **Collections.sort with lambda expressions**<br>
Interface Comparator<T> is also a functional interface and can be used with lambda expressions. <br>
  [Example code >>>>](https://pbesze.github.io/sample-codes/collections-sort-with-lambda-expressions)
  <br>
**Exception handling** <br>
Handling of exception is an important part of codeing especially when we code for real life data and  real users.<br>
