Here you can see some *example codes* of me used in tasks and exercises during my studies.

**Queries in Arraylist**<br>
To solve this task on [hackerrank.com](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/java-arraylist){:target="_blank"}:
 [Example code >>>>](https://pbesze.github.io/sample-codes/queries-in-arraylist.md)
	

	
**Implementing (the Comparator) interface**
Implementing abstract classes and interfaces are effective tools for the functionality of multiple inheritance.

  <br>
	

**Following pseudocode** <br>
In a complicated algorithm it is usefull to write and follow pseudocode as it was done for example in a trie search:
 [Example code >>>>](https://pbesze.github.io/sample-codes/following-pseudocode.md){:target="_blank"}

**RegEx** <br>
Regular expressions are useful tools while managing text based objects.
 [Example code >>>>](https://pbesze.github.io/sample-codes/regex.md){:target="_blank"}
 
**Exception handling** <br>
Handling of exception is an important part of codeing especially when we code for real life data and  real users.

 **Collections.sort with lambda expressions**<br>
