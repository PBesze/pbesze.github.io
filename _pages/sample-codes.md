Here you can see some *example codes* of me used in tasks and exercises during my studies.

**Queries in Arraylist**<br>
To solve [a task on hackerrank.com](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/java-arraylist){:target="_blank"} I wrote the following code:<br>

**Implementing (the Comparator) interface**
Implementing abstract classes and interfaces are effective tools for the functionality of multiple inheritance.<br>

**Following pseudocode** <br>
In a complicated algorithm it is usefull to write and follow pseudocode as it was done for example in a trie search:<br>

**RegEx** <br>
Regular expressions are useful tools while managing text based objects.<br>

**Exception handling** <br>
Handling of exception is an important part of codeing especially when we code for real life data and  real users.<br>
