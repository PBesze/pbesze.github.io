Here you can see some of my example codes used in tasks and exercises during my studies.<br>
*(All of the codes are tested automatedly and accepted in the tasks.)*

**Queries in Arraylist**<br>
To solve [a task on hackerrank.com](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/java-arraylist){:target="_blank"} I wrote the following code:<br>
 [Example code >>>>](https://pbesze.github.io/sample-codes/queries-in-arraylist)
	 <br>
   
**Following pseudocode** <br>
For a complicated algorithm it is useful to write and follow a pseudocode as it was done in this trie (yes, trie) search:<br>
 [Example code >>>>](https://pbesze.github.io/sample-codes/following-pseudocode)
 <br>
 
**Implementing (the Comparator) interface**<br>
Implementing abstract classes and interfaces is an effective tools for the functionality of multiple inheritance.<br>
[Example code >>>>](https://pbesze.github.io/sample-codes/implements-comparator)
  <br>

**Implementing compareTo() method** <br>
The compareTo method is another way of comparing objects:<br>
 [Example code >>>>](https://pbesze.github.io/sample-codes/implementing-compareTo)
  <br>
 
  **Collections.sort with lambda expressions**<br>
Interface Comparator is also a functional interface and can be used with lambda expressions.
<br>

**Exception handling** <br>
Handling of exceptions is an important part of coding, especially when we code for real life data and  real users.<br>
