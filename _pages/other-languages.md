I tasted Ruby and I started to learn it too.<br>
Here you can see:<br>
- My **Ruby** rank on hackerrank.com [>>>>](https://www.hackerrank.com/leaderboard?country=Hungary&page=1&practice=ruby){:target="_blank"}<br>
- The first steps of a simple under constructions ruby on rails app on Heroku, what I develop while learning.<br>
It is a twin of my spring based Java webapp.<br>

Furthermore:<br>
I use simple **SQL** on a daily basis.<br>
I used also CMS like: **WordPress**, **Blogger** and this page in Jekyll<br>
