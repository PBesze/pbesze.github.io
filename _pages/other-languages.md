I tasted Ruby and I started to learn it too.
Here you can see:
- My **Ruby** rank on hackerrank.com<br> [>>>>](https://www.hackerrank.com/leaderboard?country=Hungary&page=1&practice=ruby){:target="_blank"}
- The first steps of a simple under constructions ruby on rails app on Heroku, what I develop while learning [>>>>](https://bpmyapp2.herokuapp.com/){:target="_blank"}
<br><br>

Furthermore:
I use simple **SQL** on a daily basis.<br>
I used also CMS like: **WordPress**, **Blogger** and this page in Jekyll<br>
